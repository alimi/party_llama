# Party Llama

This little app was built to collect RSVP responses for [Ali](https://github.com/alimi) and [Tasha's](https://github.com/latazzajones/) wedding.

* Is it perfect? - No.
* Is it good enough? - Yes! 🕺🏾

# Dependencies

* Ruby (version specified in .ruby-version)
* Rails 5.2.0
* Postgres
* Twilio
* Good vibes

# Getting started

1. Checkout the repo: `git checkout git@github.com:alimi/party_llama.git`
1. Install gems: `bundle install`
1. Setup the database: `rake db:setup`
1. Start the rails server: `rails s`

Then you should see something if you go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To *really* get the app running, you'll need to get the master key from...me! #YOLO

# Tests

`rails test` will run all the tests and `rails test:system` will run the system tests.

# Other Stuff

Probably but I can't think of them right now. To be continued!
